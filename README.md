## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- I began with HTML structure, then went on to the semantic layout and accessibility.
- I then styled the structure with vanilla CSS and implemented the grid system for better responsive design.
- Javascript was added last to implement the dropdown navigation by controlling the visibility of the dropdown menu and toggling the dropdown icon dynamically.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla CSS
- Basic Javascript (DOM manipulation)

### What I learned

- How to properly link and defer Javascript file to ensure the script is loaded after the DOM is parsed
- How to use querySelectorAll to select all the relevant elements and to loop through all of them and attach event listeners
- How to change icons dynamically through using element.src
- How to implement a dropdown navigation using Javascript
- Basic Javascript DOM manipulation
- Responsive Design

### Continued development

- Make the dropdown fully keyboard accessible using focus and key events
- Javascript events and logic
- HTML and CSS accessibility and best practices
- Modular Javascript
